# NoSql

### Getting Started:

<span>1.</span> Go to the directory you want to clone the depository:  

`cd MyDirectory`

<span>2.</span> Clone the github repository:

`git clone git@github.com:yleprince/NoSql.git`

<span>3.</span> Once you have the `NoSql` folder, go inside the presentation folder:

`cd ./NoSql/presentation`

<span>4.</span> Clone the **reveal.js** repository:

`git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git`

You're now ready to watch the presentation by opening the `.html` file in your favorite browser. (NB: only this html file should be modified).


### Launch the python server:

<span>1.</span> At the root of the repository:

`python3 ./src/server.py`

<span>2.</span> Open in your favorite web browser the file
`./presentation/interactionMapPresentation.html` (at least it works in Firefox).
