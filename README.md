### Getting Started:

<span>1.</span> Go to the directory you want to clone the depository:  

`cd MyDirectory`

<span>2.</span> Clone the github repository:

`git clone git@github.com:yleprince/NoSql.git`

<span>3.</span> Once you have the `NoSql` folder, go inside the presentation folder:

`cd ./NoSql/presentation`

<span>4.</span> Clone the **reveal.js** repository:
